# The rough idea

Superanki is a high-level Chinese tutor.

Basically, you plug in Chinese paragraphs, or texts, and highlight
some words or sentences that you don't understand. Superanki will test
you on these words and sentences.

On top of that, it identifies which words give you trouble and marks
them with your proficiency at that word. When you enter new text, it
will highlight words that you're already studying as well as words
that it suspects will also give you trouble.
